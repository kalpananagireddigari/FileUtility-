##🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to design and implement a File Handling Utility using Java to perform basic file operations such as creating, writing, reading, appending, and deleting files. This task aims to provide practical understanding of Java file handling concepts and I/O classes.

##⚙️ Process

The file handling utility follows a systematic process to manage files:

A file is created using the File class.

Data is written into the file using FileWriter.

Additional data is appended to the same file without removing existing content.

The file contents are read line by line using FileReader and BufferedReader.

The file is deleted from the system using the delete method.

##📤 Outcome

The program successfully demonstrates all basic file operations in Java. 

It shows how data can be stored permanently in a file, retrieved when required, modified by appending, and finally removed from the system.

##📊 Result

A text file is created successfully.

Data is written and appended to the file.

File contents are displayed on the console.


The file is deleted after execution.

##✅ Advantages

Provides permanent storage of data.

Easy to read and maintain.

Demonstrates real-world file handling concepts.

##❌ Disadvantages

Limited to text file handling.

Does not support large files efficiently.

User input is minimal or fixed

##🧠 Conclusion

The File Handling Utility in Java effectively demonstrates basic file operations and helps in understanding how Java interacts with the file system.

This task builds a strong foundation for developing more advanced file-based applications.
